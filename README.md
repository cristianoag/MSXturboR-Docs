# MSX turboR Documentation in English

This is an attempt to better translate to english the MSX turboR documentation. As it was the last MSX model, it has a lot of features that were not present in previous models. The original documentation is in Japanese and it is not very well translated to English. This repository is an attempt to fix that.

The format chosen is MarkDown, as it is easy to read and write. The original PDF is also available in the `original` folder.
